				<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>This is an introduction so that the page doesn't aruptly start off with my mini-biography.</p>
				<p>The fact that it's starting with useless information still bothers me, though.</p>
				<p>Scroll down because the introduction ends here.</p>

			<div class="page">
				<h1>Me in a nutshell</h1>
				<p>I am a human.</p>
				<p>Call me by a gender-unspecific pronoun please.</p>
				<p>Favorite game: Minecraft, though I don't play it much, I don't play any other game so...</p>
				<p>Favorite social network: Scratch, though some people think it's not social media. We both don't seem to understand each other.</p>
				<p>Favorite species: Sheep, unless that's just the general term for a group of species, then whatever one is the cutest one, I guess.</p>
				<p>Favorite sport: I don't like sports in general. Including math competitions. <a href="http://hardmath123.github.io/math.html">That's a sport too.</a></p>
				<p>Clinton or Donald: I like Hillary because she's environmental-friendly but I also like the idea of having a new national monument and a bunch of angry Americans for 4 years.</p>
				<p>My name is Sean. Nice to meat you.</p>

				<h1>Outcomes of me being productive</h1>
				<p>When it comes to being productive, I've made a couple of things.</p>
				<p>I've mostly been on Scratch and so <a href="http://newton.nes.aau.at/~sulfurous/app.html?id=112971638&full-screen=true">here</a>'s one of my best projects.</p>
				<p>All of my CSS/JS/HTML tests are unsafely located <a href="http://176.32.230.44/thingkingland.com/">here</a>.</p>
				<p>I've also made a conlang called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGwTNp_L7kxdnqSTHRlVzfC-IHRZCns7KswKVrbxf9M/">Eyo</a>. It's not a valid language yet since no one else knows it. ;-;</p>
				<p>In Minecraft, I've made a few simple one command block creations, but I don't remember where I kept them so I guess there's no point in showing that off.</p>
				<p>And to conclude my bragging rights, my fastest mile time is at least 9 minutes. :P</p>
