This is a dictionary for the parts of speech and stuff. You know, randomness.

All the words are separated by a space.
Prounouns are in nominative form in order to be converted to their objective form when necessary.
Verbs are kept in their third-person present form.
Verbs with direct objects are in their own little list.
Let's not deal with words with special conjugation yet except for to be.
